# nth-power-of-2

- This program calculates analyzess timings between an iterative and recursive functions that achieve the same goal. It prompts the user to enter a number of trials to run and a number to use as an exponent (using 2 as the base). It then calculates the n-th power of 2 using both recurisive and iterative functions for the number of trials inputted. Finally, it calculates time taken to run all trials for both functions and it prints which function was the most effective and by how much.
